#Builder
##Description
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you produce different types and representations of an object using the same building process. Builder allows constructing complex objects step by step
##Pros
 * Allows building products step by step.
 * Allows using the same code for building different products.
 * Isolates the complex construction code from a product's core business logic.
##Cons
* Increases overall code complexity by creating multiple additional classes.
