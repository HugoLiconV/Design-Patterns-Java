# Facade
## Description
Facade is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.


## Pros
* Isolates clients from subsystem components.
* Minimizes coupling between client code and subsystem.
## Contras
* Facade risks becoming a god object, coupled to all application classes.
